ofxMSAPhysics changelog


v2.0a	29/02/09
--------------------
- a lot of new files in this one, so you'll need to remove and re-add it to your project
- no longer requires ofxVectorMath
- attractors fully implemented
- collision (between particles) fully implemented
   - you can enable/disable collision per particle, and it will collide with all other particles which have collisin enabled
   - AND/OR you can globally enable or disable collision
   - AND/OR you can manually create a collision constraint between any 2 (or more) specific particles
- you can set world dimenensions for optimized collision (using Zach L.'s binning code) and particle world edge collision
- particles have individual drag
- particles have individual bounce (for collision)
- particles have individual size (for collision and rendering)
- all 'setter' methods return the instance so you can chain them (e.g. myParticle->setMass(1)->setBonuce(0.5)->enableCollision()->makeFree(); )
- replay functionality temporarily disabled while I fix stuff
- intense testing of memory management so should be stable as a rock, lemme know if you see anything weird (turn verbose on to see whats going on)
- using the super fast inverse square root approximation (attributed to john carmack but originally from Silicon Graphics)
- lots of internal restructing and optimization



v1.2	12/11/08
--------------------
- attractor constraints added
- serialization (record and playback) added
- debug draw options
- callbacks for updaters and drawers
- getters and setters for a bunch of internal vars
- general internal restructing and optimization



v1.0	03/10/08
